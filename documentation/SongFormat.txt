openlp.org 2.x Song Database Structure
========================================================================

Introduction
------------
The song database in openlp.org 2.x is similar to the 1.x format. The
biggest differences are the addition of extra tables, and the use of
SQLite version 3.

The song database contains the following tables:
- authors
- authors_songs
- song_books
- songs
- songs_topics
- topics


"authors" Table
---------------
This table holds the names of all the authors. It has the following
columns:

* id
* first_name
* last_name
* display_name


"authors_songs" Table
---------------------
This is a bridging table between the "authors" and "songs" tables, which
serves to create a many-to-many relationship between the two tables. It
has the following columns:

* author_id
* song_id


"song_books" Table
------------------
The "song_books" table holds a list of books that a congregation gets
their songs from, or old hymnals now no longer used. This table has the
following columns:

* id
* name

"songs" Table
-------------
This table contains the songs, and each song has a list of attributes.

serves to create a many-to-many relationship between the two tables. It
has the following columns:

* song_id
