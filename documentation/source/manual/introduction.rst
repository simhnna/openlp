About
-----

OpenLP is an open source lyrics projection application developed specifically
for churches. It is licensed under the GNU Generic Public License, which means
that it is free to use and distribute, and it stays free.

Lyrics Projection
-----------------

OpenLP's purpose is to project the lyrics of songs and Bible verses using a 
computer and a data projector. OpenLP also has the ability to project videos, 
images, and also play audio. OpenLP also is highly customizable providing users 
with the ability to set up a wide variety of themes, including themes with 
video backgrounds.

Open Source
-----------

OpenLP is open source software. This means that the source code (the 
programming instructions the developers write) is open to anyone who wants to 
look at it. This gives you, the end user, a few freedoms.

From a developer's perspective, it gives you the freedom to inspect the code 
and make sure that it is not malicious. Also, it gives you the freedom to 
change the code and the freedom to "fork" the project and make it your own.

For end users open source software gives you the freedom to use software as 
you wish. You are not required to pay for the software and you are free to 
make copies and distribute it to anyone you want.

GNU General Public License
--------------------------

The GNU General Public License was specifically chosen because it ensures the 
above mentioned freedoms. It specifically states that you are not allowed 
to charge for the software, and that you have to distribute the source code as 
well.
