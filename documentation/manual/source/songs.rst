version 1 songs.

Importing from OpenSong
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Converting from OpenSong, you will need to locate your songs database. In the 
later versions of OpenSong you are asked to define the location of this. The 
songs will be located in a folder named :guilabel:`Songs`. This folder will
contain files with all your songs in them, without a file extension. (file.xxx).
When you have located this folder you will need to select the songs from
the folder.
