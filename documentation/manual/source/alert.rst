Tools/Alert
^^^^^^^^^^^
You may find it necessary to display an Alert on your screen, ie: car headlights 
left on, parent needed in nursery or anything else somebody may need notified 
about.This is easily done using the Alert which is accessible from the top Menu 
under Tools/Alert.

`Alert text` Enter the message you want displayed in this box.

`Parameter` This box is used for words you want to insert into the alert text.
 
You add the Parameter text into the alert text using “<>” (without quotations). 
Anywhere in the Alert text that you add these two symbols, <> side by side, will 
insert any text you have in the parameter box into the Alert message.

**Examples of use** 
`Alert text` The owner of the vehicle with license plate number <> your lights 
are on.
`Parameter` HNN432
These two settings will display like this:
The owner of the vehicle with the license plate number HNN432 your lights are on.
You could also reverse this example:
`Alert text` HNN432 <>
`Parameter` left their lights on.
`Will display like this` HNN432 left their lights on.

If you use the same alerts on a regular basis, Save your Alert and you will have 
access to the alert with a click of the mouse. You may also click on New for a 
new alert or Delete an alert you do not need.

When you are ready to Display your Alert you have two options. Clicking on 
Display will display the Alert and the Alert Message window will remain open. 
Clicking Display & Close will display the alert and close the Alert Message 
window. 

All details of the display, font, color, size and position are adjusted from the 
top Menu item Settings/Configure OpenLP, Alert tab and the instructions here.
