Once you get your system set up for OpenLP you will be ready to add content to
your setup. This will all happen through the **Media Manager**. The
`Media Manager` contains all the bibles, songs, presentations, media, and 
everything else that you will project through OpenLP.

Enabling the Plugins
--------------------

You may need to enable the plugins that came with OpenLP. As you can see below
this is what the `Media Manager` looks like with all the plugins enabled.
