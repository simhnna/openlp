    <p> This draft version of the World English Bible is
substantially complete in the New Testament, Genesis, Exodus, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, and the “minor” prophets. Editing continues on the other books of the Old Testament. All WEB companion Apocrypha books are still in
rough draft form. </p>
    <p>Converted web.gbf in GBF to web.osis.xml in
an XML format that is mostly compliant with OSIS 2.0 using gbf2osis.exe.
(Please see http://ebt.cx/translation/ for links to this software.)</p>
    <p>GBF and OSIS metadata fields do not exactly correspond to each other, so
the conversion is not perfect in the metadata. However, the Scripture portion
should be correct.</p>
    <p>No attempt was to convert quotation marks to structural markers using q or
speech elements, because this would require language and style-dependent
processing, and because the current OSIS specification is deficient in that
quotation mark processing is not guaranteed to produce the correct results
for all languages and translations. In English texts, the hard part of the
conversion to markup is figuring out what ’ means.
The other difficulty is that OSIS in no way guarantees that these punctuation
marks would be reconstituted properly by software that reads OSIS files
for anything other than modern English, and even then, it does not
accommodate all styles of punctuation and all cases.
We strongly recommend that anyone using OSIS NOT replace quotation mark
punctuation in any existing text with q or speech elements. It is better
for multiple language processing capabilities to leave the quotation
punctuation as part of the text. If you need the q or speech markup, then you
may supplement those punctuation marks with those markup elements, but specify
the n='' parameter in those elements to indicate that no generation of any
punctuation from those markup elements is required or desired. That way you
can have BOTH correct punctuation already in the text AND markup so that you
can automatically determine when you are in a quotation or not, independent
of language. This may be useful for a search by speaker, for example.</p>
    <p>The output of gbf2osis marks Jesus' words in a non-standard way using the q
element AND quotation marks if they were marked with FR/Fr markers in the GBF
file. The OSIS 2.0 specification requires that quotation marks be stripped out,
and reinserted by software that reads the OSIS files when q elements are used.
This is not acceptable for the reasons given above, and we choose not to do
that, but we used the q element with who='Jesus' to indicate Jesus' words.
Do not generate any additional punctuation due to these markers. The correct
punctuation is already in the text.</p>
    <p>OSIS does not currently support footnote start anchors. Therefore, these
start anchors have been represented with milestone elements, in case someone
might like to use them, for example, to start an href element in a conversion
to HTML. (OSIS sort of supports the same idea by allowing a catchword to be
defined within a footnote, but I did not implement the processing to convert
to this different way of doing things, and it isn't exactly the same, anyway.)</p>
    <p>Traditional psalm book titles are rendered as text rather than titles, because
the title element does not support containing transChange elements, as would be
required to encode the KJV text using OSIS title elements. This may actually be
a superior solution, anyway, in that the Masoretic text makes no such distinction
(even though many modern typeset Bibles do make a typographic distinction in this
case).</p>
    <p>The schema location headers were modified to use local copies rather than the
standard locations so that these files could be validated and used without an
Internet connection active at all times (very important for the developer's
remote island location), but you may wish to change them back.</p>
